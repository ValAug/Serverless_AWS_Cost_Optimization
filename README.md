This GitHub repository showcases the powerful trio of Terraform, AWS Lambda, and Event Bridge for achieving cost optimization in your AWS infrastructure. With a focus on automation and intelligent strategies, you can effectively reduce AWS expenditure without compromising performance or functionality.

## üîë Key Features

- **Infrastructure as Code:** Define your AWS infrastructure in a declarative manner using Terraform configurations, enabling easy versioning, management, and environment reproducibility.

- **Lambda Functions:** Explore the creation of serverless functions using AWS Lambda to perform specific tasks in response to events. Examples include processing incoming data or triggering automated actions.

- **Event Bridge:** Learn how to leverage AWS Event Bridge to establish event-driven architectures, enabling decoupled communication between different services. This facilitates efficient cost optimization through event filtering and routing.

- **Cost Optimization Techniques:** Discover various techniques for AWS cost optimization, including intelligent resource scaling, serverless architecture design patterns, efficient event routing, and usage-based cost analysis.

- **Sample Workflows:** Find practical examples of cost optimization workflows that combine Terraform, Lambda functions, and Event Bridge rules. These workflows automate common tasks, minimize resource usage, and reduce unnecessary costs.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Prerequisites

- You must have an AWS account and configure your CLI profile.
- Terraform must be installed. [Learn how to install Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli)
- ## Please first completed part one you will need the EC2 instance ID's i-xxxxxxxxxxxxx from the output provided after this deployment is done. You can also copy them from the console once is completed [Part one EC2 Creation](https://github.com/ValAug/aws-compu-terraform)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Cautions

- As an AWS best practice, grant this code least privilege, providing only the necessary permissions to perform a task. For more information, see [Grant Least Privilege](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#grant-least-privilege) in the *AWS Identity and Access Management User Guide*.
- This code has been tested in the __us-east-1__ AWS Region only. However, it should work in any other region.
- Running this code may result in charges to your AWS account.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run This Code

## üöÄ Quick Start

```bash
cd serverless_AWS_cost_optimization
terraform init
terraform validate
terraform plan
terraform apply --auto-approve
```

## üí• Quick Destroy
```bash
terraform destroy --auto-approve
```

## üìå Notes
```bash
- clone this Git repo
- cd to the the directory serverless_AWS_cost_optimization
- copy __EC2_ID's__ from previous deployment and paste them each on __start.py__ and __stop.py__ place holders
- use terraform __init__ command to initialize the Terraform working directory and to download plugins for a provider (aws)
- terraform validate command will validate the code before actual deployment
- terraform plan command will show the execution code before making the actual deployment
- terraform apply
- Alternate command : terraform apply -auto-approve
- terraform destroy
- Alternate command : terraform destroy -auto-approve
- terraform fmt -recursive # A way to format the terraform code
```
